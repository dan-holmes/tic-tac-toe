# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac_Toe example created for the "testing behaviour rather than state" practical [here] (https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/testing/behaviour_not_state.md)

This is not a fully functioning game, but just an example of how you would start the project using behaviour led TDD.
